Hoc Diu Tempus Sumpsit Remote-Controlled Robotic Arm

This project is a Bluetooth robotic arm, also known as “Hoc Diu Tempus Sumpsit.” It is a Bluetooth-controlled, 4-Bar linkage robotic arm powered by an ESP32. 
The arm features four axes of rotation, a wireless remote controller, and a three-finger helical-gear gripper designed for grasping circular objects. 
The system uses four servo motors to drive the rotating base, shoulder joint, wrist joint, and gripper.
