# HDTS Robotic Arm

This project is a Bluetooth robotic arm, also known as the “Hoc Diu Tempus Sumpsit.”. It is a 3D-printed, Bluetooth-controlled, 4-Bar linkage robotic arm powered by 2 ESP-WROOM-32s. The arm features three axes of rotation, a wireless remote controller, and a three-finger helical-gear gripper designed for grasping circular objects. The system uses four servo motors to drive the rotating base, shoulder joint, wrist joint, and gripper, controlled by a joystick remote that switches channels for each servo. There are two main parts of the project: the physical robotic arm (SERVER) and the remote controller that sends controls to the server(CLIENT). The server side consists of an ESP-WROOM-32 microcontroller, a PCA9685, 4 servo motors (2x MG996R, 1x SG90, 1x Spektrum A330), and the whole operating arm powered by a 6V 3A power supply. The client side consists of another ESP-WROOM-32 microcontroller and an x/y axis push button joystick powered by a 3.7V 300mA LiPo battery. The server side reads the joystick analog output and converts it into motion for each of the servos.
