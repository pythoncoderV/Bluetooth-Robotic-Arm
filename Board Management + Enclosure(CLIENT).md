Board Management + Enclosure(CLIENT):

For the ESP-WROOM-32 joystick remote, I was using an ESP-WROOM-32 microcontroller and a 5 pin 2 axis(x,y) push button Joystick. This was the main wiring but I also wanted to wire a 
switch to turn the microcontroller off and a battery to power it wirelesseley. Due to this, I wanted to 3d-print an enclosure/case for all the electronics to go into and to make 
it look polished. I was able to find a pre-made model on thingiverse-com of a joystick remote case along with a bit of extra space for microcontrollers and other electronics.

I then printed the case in white with inspiration from WII controllers. After printing I fit the ESP-WROOM-32 microcontroller along with the joystick into their respective potions
and the battery. The on and off switch was placed outside of the case for easy-access through a pre-made hole to my coincidence. After placing all the components I tried to fit the 
top but the components below were protruding so the bottom and top of the enclosure wouldn't make contact and fit together. I then found a solution to this problem by taking the lid
and increasing it by 10mm in height just around the edges so the design had more depth. After printing the part again I placed the lid ontop and it fit perfectly. Although there was
a minor problem in power through the battery (Refer to Power Management.md), I was able to fix it and then seal the top in. It was also very convenient through the design that you could 
see the POWER ON LED of the ESP-WROOM-32 microcontroller indicating that the remote is on.
