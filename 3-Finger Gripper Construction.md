GRIPPER CONSTRUCTION :

The part of the project woould be responsible for picking things up and putting them down as well as moving objects. I wanted this design to be specifically for gripping circular 
objects. This is becuase I wanted the main focus of my robotic arm to be picking things up like balls and other round 3d-shapes. I originally started to think about 2 finger grippers
as they are the default gripper design for most robotic arms but I did not think that design would be efficient enough at picking circular objects. I later came to the idea of using
3 fingers equally spaced apart in the formation of a triangle. This left no space for the objects to get out of the grip. The next thing I had to think about was how I was going to 
turn the rotational movement of the sg90 servo motor, into the motion where a gripper can close it's fingers in. I started researching different types of gears for this too. I looked
at spur gears, rack and pinion gears, bevel gears untill I found a type of gear called a Helical Gear. These gears proved to be the most efficient of all the ones I researched on. 
They had the propoerty of rotating and meshing on perpendicular axis. This meant if I had my servo motor with a hellical gear attached to it, and a finger with a helical gear attached 
to it, when I orient it properly the finger will move up and down when th eservo rotates. Another plus side to this type of gear was due to how it doesnt just rotate perpendicularly,
it can rotate side by side just like normal gears. I discovered if you reflect the direction of which the grooves on a helical gear are positioned, that reflected gear meshes side by
side with a normal un-reflected gear. I soon got to work designing the chamber for the a single rotating hellical gear to sit and 3 hellical gears meshing with that one rotating gear
around it(un-reflected). I designed this by taking a pre-made file on printables.com. The printables.com file was a fidget toy design that had a chamber and 2 hellical gears in it that
already rotated on vertical axis. I then had to duplicate the chamber 3 times so I could create a traingular shape where 3 gears could fit perpendicularly. I made sure that the inner 
rotating gear was meshing all 3 of the hellical gears so that when the inner hellical gear rotates, all 3 of the outer ones rotate too moving the fingers in and out/ up and down. I 
designed poles with the right tolerences to keep the hellical gears in place while they could still rotate.

I then took each of the 3 hellical gears on the outer radius of the chamber and attached beams to the or "finger" with curves on the tops so that they could grip circular objects better.
The next thing i had to think of was where and how I was going to mount the motor.
