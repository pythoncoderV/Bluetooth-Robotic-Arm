WRIST JOINT CONSTRUCTION: 

This part of the project is to move the later designed gripper up and down adding more flexibility to the arm as a whole. The wrist joint will be mounted ontop of the slope of the 
shoulder joint 4-Bar linkage. It will add a third axis of movement to the arm so it can pick up objects at a wider range. It will be powered using an A330 Specktrum servo motor. 
This design was the most hectic out of all the ones following multiple iterations(3). I originally thought of using another MG996R but that would be too much weight for the shoulder joint 4-Bar linkage to handle. My first design was inspired by the use of revolute joints. I designed a bracket that could hold 2 sg90 servos and the servos would work together to lift the later engineered gripper. The reason I used 2 servo motors instead of one like the rest of the design was due to how the gripper construction I was working on at the same time was going to be very heavy. I used pre-made servo cases that I took from Thingiverse.com and fit them into the bracket I made. This design did not work in the end becuase of testing. I had already printed the design for the 3-finger gripper in the mean time while designing it so i decided to use that to test the power of the 2 servos. I then mounted the brack with sticky tape for prototyping on the end panel of the shoulder joint 4-Bar linkage I constructed before. The sg90's were fully capable of carrying the grippers wait, however they soon started falling apart. One servo lost its initial potition so that meant both servos were not in sync, causing the servo in sync to break. I had to scrap that idea and move on to design #2. This used an entirely different motor or the 28BYJ-48 stepper motor becuase I believed one stronger motor was more efficient. I soon set up the ULN2003 stepper motor driver module as well as the stepper motor. This design worked well when I used sticky tape again to secure the stepper motor to the gripper. I again took a pre-made case from Thingiverse for the stepper motor using sticky tape to this time secure to the side of the end panel of the shoulder joint 4-Bar linkage. The stepper motor was strong and easy to code while moving the gripper up and down. It seemed like a perfect design, untill I decided to connect all motors to finish the project. I had already glued the stepper motor shaft to the gripper so it would be hard to turn back. When I tested the stepper motor and all the other servos, the stepper motor wasn't moving at all. I believe this was due to a shortage in currect and power. The problem was that I was supplying power through the servo motor driver board, but it had a limit in power input so i was stuck. I then desided to move onto my final design #3. I had to find a motor that could handle the weight of the gripper as well as not take up to much current and power. This search was going on for days untill I scavenged through my electronic parts and found a Spektrum A330 motor. I did not think a servo of that size would be powerful enough to power my project but it actually showed a torque higher than the average sg90 servo motor, and it took less voltage. I took used sticky tape to secure it to the end panel of the shoulder joint 4-Bar linkage, and then attached the gripper to the shaft of it. It was very capable of moving the gripper up and down and was perfectly fitting alll the criteria I was hoping for, so it was time to hot-glue everything together. After hotglueing I had a full working wrist joint and the robotic arm mechanical part was mostly done, due to how I had already designed the 3-finger gripper. 

I lost the CAD design for design #1's Bracket due to a mistaken refresh on my computer but here are pictures:

This is design #2's stepper motor case link I took from thingiverse as well as the 28BYJ-48 stepper motor + ULN2003 stepper motor driver module picture:
