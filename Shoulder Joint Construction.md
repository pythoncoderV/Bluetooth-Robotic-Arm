SHOULDER JOINT CONSTRUCTION:

This part of the project was used to linearly move the robotic arm up and down. My idea for this design was to use a 4-Bar linkage Mechanism for the up and down motion.
I chose this specific design due to how the beginning of the arm remains parallel to the beginning panel and when the arm would be in action, I would not have to do much work to get it to one position by using multiple joints. I used my second and last MG996R servo motor to power this. I attached a gear to one of the beams in the linkage with superglue for power later on. When the linkage moved up and down the gear would rotate counterclockwise and clockwise respectively. To power the 4-Bar linkage I superglued a second gear onto the MG996R so that the gear from the servo motor and the gear from the 4-Bar linkage would chain together meaning the servo would move the linkage up and down. To not have the 4 bar linkage be upright, and to have the structure at an angle to later pick up lower objects, I designed and 3D-printed a 45 degree slope that the beginning panel of the 4 bar linkage would be superglued on. This made sure that the servo motor had more reach for objects on ground level and above. For vertical height on the 4-Bar linkage I used a combination of LEGO bricks that would be superglued below the slope so the arm could pick objects that were higher as well. I then finally mounted the MG996R servo motor as well as the gear attached to it to the slope/beginning panel of the 4-Bar linkage so the gear on the linkage as well as the gear on the servo motor could mesh together. After doing this I secured it to the circular base I constructed before with superglue. Now the 2-axis of rotation were done as well as my MG996R servos being used up.

Through the testing of the motors, I realized that since I added a 45 degree slope at the beginning of 4-Bar linkage, I had to add one at the end so they would cross angles out so the 
beginning panel + end panel were parallel again. To do this I took the same 45 degree slope I 3D-printed before and superglued it to the end.

After supergluing the Shoulder Joint to the Base(I added a rubber band for strength testing the MG996R and 2 servos on the top for the later constructed wrist joint + I printed covering pieces in silk blue PLA to make the arm look nicer):
