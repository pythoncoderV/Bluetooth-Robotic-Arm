SHOULDER JOINT CONNSTRUCTION:

This part of the project was used to linearly move the robotic arm up and down. My idea for this design was to use a 4-Bar linkage Mechanism for the up and down motion.
I chose this specific design due to how the end of the arm remains parallel to the beginning panel. I used my second and last MG996R servo motor to power this. I attached
a gear to one of the beams in the linkage with superglue. When the linkage moved up and down the gear would rotate counterclockwise and clockwise respectively. To power 
the 4-Bar linkage I superglued a second gear onto the MG996R so that the gear from the servo motor and the gear from the 4-Bar linkage would chain together so the servo 
would in turn move the linkage up and down. To not have the 4 bar linkage be upright, and to have the structure at an agnel to later pick up objects, I designed and 3d-printed 
a 45 degree slope that the end panel of the 4 bar linkage would be superglued on. This made sure that the servo motor had more reach for objects on ground floor and more. For 
height on the 4-Bar linkage I used a combination of lego bricks that would be superglued below the slope so the arm could pick objects that were higher as well. I then finally
mounted the MG996R servo motor as well as the gear attached to it to the slope/ end panel of the 4-Bar linkage so the gear on the linkage as well as the gear on the servo motor
could mesh together. After doing this I secured it to the circular base I constructed before with superglue. Now the 2-axis of rotation were done as well as my MG996R servos
being used up.

Through the testing of the motors, I realized that since I added a 45 degree slope at the end of 4-Bar linkage, I had to add one at the top so they would cross out and the 
end panel + beginning panel were parallel again. I then took the same 45 degree slope I 3d-printede before and superglued it to the top.
