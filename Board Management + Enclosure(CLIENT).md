WIRING + BOARD MANAGEMENT:

For the ESP-WROOM-32 joystick remote, I was using an ESP-WROOM-32 microcontroller and a 5 pin 2 axis(x,y) push button Joystick. This was the main wiring but I also wanted to wire a 
switch to turn the microcontroller off and a battery to power it wirelesseley. Due to this, I wanted to 3d-print an enclosure/case for all the electronics to go into and to make 
it look polished.
