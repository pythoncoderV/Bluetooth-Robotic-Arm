WRIST JOINT CONSTRUCTION: 

This part of the project is to move the later designed gripper up and down adding more flexibility to the arm as a whole. The wrist joint will be mounted ontop of the slope of the 
shoulder joint 4-Bar linkage. It will add a second axis of movement to the arm so it can pick up objects at a wider range. It will be powered using an A330 Specktrum servo motor. 
This design was the most hectic out of all the ones following multiple iterations(4).
