WIRING + BOARD MANAGEMENT:

To control the PCA9685 and servos, I initially planned an Arduino Mega (server) and Arduino Nano (client) setup. The Arduino nano with its joystick would send signals to the Arduino Mega's arm. My way of doing this was by using a long wire and connecting the ESP-WROOM-32 joystick remote to the arm so it would look wireless. I later discarded this idea because it looked unproffesional, and because I often tripped over it. This took me to the idea of using bluetooth for the connection of client and server. I first attempted using two HC-05 modules but struggled with wiring (TX/RX resistors), pairing, and lack of code transmission. Videos I found online for the modules were not useful and didn't go into detail enough for me.
Due to this, I switched to ESP-WROOM-32 microcontrollers because they have integrated Bluetooth  while also being faster and cheap. To enable the Arduino IDE app communication with the ESP-WROOM-32’s CP2102 chip, I had to install a specific driver from Silicon Labs. After the Arduino IDE app sensed the ESP-WROOM-32 microcontroller, I went to finish the KiCad wiring completely. For the physical arm(server) I had the PCA9685 and the ESP-WROOM-32 microcontroller just laying out so I designed a case for them. I had actually already 3D-printed an enclosure for the parts but that was when my plan was leaning towards the Arduino Mega and Nano. I did not want to scrap that 3D-design because I thought it came out well, so I used it in the final product. I used a pre-made enclosure for the PCA9685 on thingiverse.com and one for the Arduino Mega at that time too. I wanted the case to be attached or glued around the PVC 106mm circular base I used during the Base Construction. For this designed a rectangle with an arc cut out of it so it would fit perfectly around the PVC circular base. I then grouped the parts together; the arc-cut rectangle, the Arduino Mega/ New ESP-WROOM-32 case, and the PCA9685.

In the CAD model I added two deep holes in the arc-cut rectangle. This was because I had been having problems with the weight distribution as the shoulder joint, wrist joint, and gripper were heavy and causing the arm to lose balance. I recently got small compact lead balls for black friday and was planning to place groups of them in each hole to increase the weight
in that area so the center of gravity would shift to my advantage. To fit the PCA9685, I used hotglue and the poles pre-printed for stability, and to attach the whole case, I hotglued
the arc-cut rectangle to the PVC circular base of the arm. For the Arduino Mega/ESP-WROOM-32 enclosure, I mounted the ESP-WROOM-32 on a breadboard and due to a standard bread-board having the same
width as an Arduino Mega, the ESP-WROOM-32 on breadboard fit perfectly, without the use of hotglue. The bread-board was also useful due to the fact that in the KiCad wiring all grounds had to
be common so the bread-board power rails came in handy.
