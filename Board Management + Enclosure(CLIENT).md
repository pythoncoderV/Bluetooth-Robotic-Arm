Board Management + Enclosure(CLIENT):

For the ESP-WROOM-32 joystick remote, I was using an ESP-WROOM-32 microcontroller and a 5-pin 2-axis (x,y) push button joystick. This was the main wiring, but I also wanted to wire a switch to turn the microcontroller off and a battery to power it wirelessly. Due to this, I wanted to 3D-print an enclosure/case for all the electronics to go into and to make it look polished. I was able to find a pre-made model on thingiverse.com of a joystick remote case along with a bit of extra space for microcontrollers and other electronics.

I then printed the case in white with inspiration from Wii controllers. After printing, I fit the ESP-WROOM-32 microcontroller along with the joystick into their respective portions.
and the battery. The on and off switch was placed outside of the case for easy access through a pre-made hole to my convenience. After placing all the components, I tried to fit the 
top, but the components below were protruding, so the bottom and top of the enclosure wouldn't make contact and fit together. I then found a solution to this problem by taking the lid.
and increasing it by 10 mm in height just around the edges so the design had more depth. After printing the part again, I placed the lid on top, and it fit perfectly. Although there was
a minor problem in power through the battery (refer to Power Management.md), I was able to fix it and then seal the top in. It was also very convenient through the design that you 
could see the POWER ON LED of the ESP-WROOM-32 microcontroller indicating that the remote is on.
